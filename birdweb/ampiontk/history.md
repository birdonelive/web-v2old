# Ampion History

- Ampion pArk was opened to the public on December 8th, 2022 as a small park near Pramuan Street.
- Tours happened every day there, which were hosted by Ratchawit.
- A few days after, El Ampion Gallery was opened by Mister Monte. A link to the website was later opened here.
- Ampion Search was later opened as an alternative to Google, which featured cool websites like this one, and El Ampion Gallery. 
- In Mid-December, this website was opened as a shortcut to all Ampion Websites. The ampion.tk domain was registered later.
- More pages were opened later, like the vote page, the Mosquito Central page, and the stories page.
- On December 26th, 2022, the Ampion Official YouTube channel was opened. A shortcut to that page was opened shortly after. On the same day, all Ampion services merged into Ampion World.
